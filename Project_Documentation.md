## Project proposal - Multiversum - Leonardo Patrignani

#

### Design brief 

#### This project proposal focuses on designing an engaging and interactive website based on the book Multiversum by Leonardo Patrignani. The website will provide an immersive experience, allowing users to explore the concept of parallel universes, key characters, and the storyâ€™s central themes. The target audience will primarily be teenagers and young adults who enjoy science fiction, adventure, and thought-provoking stories. The website will serve both as a companion to the book and a standalone experience to attract new readers.

#

### Book Choice and Justification

#### The book is Multiversum by Leonardo Patrignani. Multiversum follows the story of Alex and Jenny, two teenagers who share a mysterious telepathic connection. When they finally meet, they discover they exist in different parallel universes. Together, they embark on a thrilling journey across realities, uncovering the secrets of the multiverse and their own destinies.

#### I chose Multiversum because of its unique exploration of parallel universes and how small decisions can lead to vastly different outcomes. The storyâ€™s intriguing premise and imaginative worldbuilding inspired me to design a website that would allow users to experience these alternate realities firsthand through interactive content and visual storytelling.

#

### User Experience Type

#### My project will take the form of a website. I think a website is an ideal format because it allows for rich multimedia experiences, combining text, images, animations, and interactive elements. This format will enhance the storyâ€™s themes by letting users actively navigate through different universes, unlock hidden content, and explore character profiles, timelines, and alternate reality maps. It captures the sense of curiosity and discovery central to Multiversum.

#

### Target Market

#### The intended audience is teenagers and young adults, approximately age 15 and up, with an interest in science fiction, alternate realities, and speculative fiction. This audience should be comfortable with digital experiences and enjoy interactive storytelling.

#### I think this project will appeal to them because it brings the fascinating concept of parallel universes to life in a format they are familiar with â€” a website. By combining sleek visuals, engaging animations, and interactive story elements, the site will offer a fresh and immersive way to experience the bookâ€™s content, encouraging both fans of the book and newcomers to explore further.

#### The design choices will cater to this audience by including:
* A modern, sleek design, appealing to young audiences.
* Interactive story elements, letting users explore at their own pace
* A simple navigation scheme site-wide to allow easy understanding of all the different components of the website and the book experience itself

#

### Software and Tools
* Adobe XD (for wireframing and prototyping)
* HTML/CSS/Javascript (for website development)
