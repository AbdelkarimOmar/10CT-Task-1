## Project proposal - Multiversum - Leonardo Patrignani

---

### Design brief 

#### This project proposal focuses on designing an engaging and interactive website based on the book Multiversum by Leonardo Patrignani. The website will provide an immersive experience, allowing users to explore the concept of parallel universes, key characters, and the story’s central themes. The target audience will primarily be teenagers and young adults who enjoy science fiction, adventure, and thought-provoking stories. The website will serve both as a companion to the book and a standalone experience to attract new readers.

### Book Choice and Justification

#### The book is Multiversum by Leonardo Patrignani. Multiversum follows the story of Alex and Jenny, two teenagers who share a mysterious telepathic connection. When they finally meet, they discover they exist in different parallel universes. Together, they embark on a thrilling journey across realities, uncovering the secrets of the multiverse and their own destinies.

#### I chose Multiversum because of its unique exploration of parallel universes and how small decisions can lead to vastly different outcomes. The story’s intriguing premise and imaginative worldbuilding inspired me to design a website that would allow users to experience these alternate realities firsthand through interactive content and visual storytelling.

### User Experience Type

#### My project will take the form of a website. I think a website is an ideal format because it allows for rich multimedia experiences, combining text, images, animations, and interactive elements. This format will enhance the story’s themes by letting users actively navigate through different universes, unlock hidden content, and explore character profiles, timelines, and alternate reality maps. It captures the sense of curiosity and discovery central to Multiversum.

### Target Market

#### The intended audience is teenagers and young adults, approximately age 15 and up, with an interest in science fiction, alternate realities, and speculative fiction. This audience should be comfortable with digital experiences and enjoy interactive storytelling.

#### I think this project will appeal to them because it brings the fascinating concept of parallel universes to life in a format they are familiar with — a website. By combining sleek visuals, engaging animations, and interactive story elements, the site will offer a fresh and immersive way to experience the book’s content, encouraging both fans of the book and newcomers to explore further.

#### The design choices will cater to this audience by including:
* A modern, sleek design, appealing to young audiences.
* Interactive story elements, letting users explore at their own pace
* A simple navigation scheme site-wide to allow easy understanding of all the different components of the website and the book experience itself

### Software and Tools
* Adobe XD (for wireframing and prototyping)
* HTML/CSS/Javascript (for website development)

## Social, Ethical and Legal Considerations
---
### Target Audience Considerations
#### To get Multiversum noticed by new readers through a website, I need to pinpoint who I'm aiming for. Mostly, it's going to be young adults who are into sci-fi, fantasy, and stories with strong emotions. The website needs to be mobile-friendly, as well as desktop friendly, since that's how they're likely to access it.
####  I'll need to explain the book's complex ideas in a way that's easy to grasp, while still highlighting the exciting adventure and emotional depth. Visually, it should be engaging, maybe with some interactive elements. Crucially, it needs to provide clear information about the book and the author.
#### Essentially, the website should act as an inviting and informative space that captures the essence of Multiversum for potential readers.
---
### Potential Benefits

#### How is this website going to be a good thing for people? Potentially, it is going to encourage reading. By giving potential readers a taste of Multiversum with excerpts and cool visuals, it'll spark their curiosity and make them want to dive into the book. Plus, by making the complex ideas accessible, it removes a potential barrier to entry.

#### This will enhance the overall experience for individuals interested in Multiversum or similar books, encouraging a deeper appreciation and engagement with the narrative.

## Researching and Planning

### Researching Existing UIs

| UI name | Plus | Minus | Implication |
|---------|------|-------|----------|
| **Headspace** | Clean, simplistic design with abundant white space. The website uses accessibility-friendly functional aspects although there are not too many of them. It uses bright, pleasing colours to appeal to users who have come to the website seeking mental health advice.| May be leaning too far towards simplicity over function, text is too compact which contrasts with its aim at a pleasing experience | Will integrate the general aesthetic that makes it a pleasing experience to use, while staying away from compact text or any cramped spaces |
| **Github/Gitbook** | The UI is straightforward and tidy while maintaining a functioning nature. It also has personalisable aspects that make the user experience much more accessible. | Is more of a website with a function rather than one with an immersive "feel". Uses solid colours that are either extremely bright or extremely dark to maintain its simplicity, which could be limiting its appeal | Will integrate multiple design aspects that corroborate function and useability
| **YouTube** | The UI gives the user full control over how they use the website while effectively maintaining accessibility, function and informational design, which would be an evident factor for the huge amount of users that use this website daily. | Apart from so many components being fitted on a limited screen, YouTube has the same problem as the other websites where about 95% of the entire UI is either white or black (apart from the thumbnails of the videos on the home page) which compromises appeal once more. | Will integrate its functional sense that follows the user rather than try to appeal to everyone all at once.
